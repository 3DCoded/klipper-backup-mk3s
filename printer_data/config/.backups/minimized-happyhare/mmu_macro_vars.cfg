description: Happy Hare tip forming macro configuration variables
gcode: # Leave empty

# Step 1 - Ramming
# Ramming is the initial squeeze of filament prior to cooling moves and is
# described in terms of total volume and progression of squeeze intensity
# printing/standalone. This can be separately controlled when printing or
# standalone
variable_ramming_volume            : 0		; Volume in mm^3, 0 = disabled (optionally let slicer do it)
variable_ramming_volume_standalone : 0		; Volume in mm^3, 0 = disabled

# Optionally set for temperature change (reduction). The wait will occur
# before nozzle separation if 'use_fast_skinnydip: False' else after cooling
# moves. Temperature will be restored after tip creation is complete
variable_toolchange_temp        : 0		; 0 = don't change temp, else temp to set
variable_toolchange_fan_assist  : False		; Whether to use part cooling fan for quicker temp change
variable_toolchange_fan_speed   : 50		; Fan speed % if using fan_assist enabled

# Step 2 - Nozzle Separation
# The filament is then quickly separated from the meltzone by a fast movement
# before then slowing to travel the remaining distance to cooling tube. The
# initial fast movement should be as fast as extruder can comfortably perform.
# A good starting point# for slower move is unloading_speed_start/cooling_moves.
# Too fast a slower movement can lead to excessively long tips or hairs
variable_unloading_speed_start  : 80		; Speed in mm/s for initial fast movement
variable_unloading_speed        : 18		; Speed in mm/s for slow move to cooling zone

# Step 3 - Cooling Moves
# The cooling move allows the filament to harden while constantly moving back
# and forth in the cooling tube portion of the extruder to prevent a bulbous
# tip forming. The cooling tube position is measured from the internal nozzle
# to just past the top of the heater block (often it is beneficial to add a
# couple of mm to ensure the tip is in the cooling section. The cooling tube
# length is then the distance from here to top of heatsink (this is the length
# length of the cooling moves). The final cooling move is a fast movement to
# break the string formed.
variable_cooling_tube_position  : 35		; Start of cooling tube. DragonST:35, DragonHF:30, Mosquito:30, Revo:35, RapidoHF:27
variable_cooling_tube_length    : 10		; Movement length. DragonST:15, DragonHF:10, Mosquito:20, Revo:10, RapidoHF:10
variable_initial_cooling_speed  : 10		; Inital slow movement (mm/s) to solidify tip and cool string if formed
variable_final_cooling_speed    : 50		; Fast movement (mm/s) Too fast: tip deformation on eject, Too Slow: long string/no seperation
variable_cooling_moves          : 4		; Number of back and forth cooling moves to make (2-4 is a good start)

# Step 4 - Skinnydip
# Skinnydip is an advanced final move that may have benefit with some
# material like PLA to burn off persistent very fine hairs. To work the
# depth of insertion is critical (start with it disabled and tune last)
# For reference the internal nozzle would be at a distance of
# cooling_tube_position + cooling_tube_length, the top of the heater
# block would be cooling_tube_length away.
variable_use_skinnydip          : False		; True = enable skinnydip, False = skinnydip move disabled
variable_skinnydip_distance     : 30		; Distance to reinsert filament into hotend starting from end of cooling tube
variable_dip_insertion_speed    : 30		; Medium/Slow insertion speed mm/s - Just long enough to melt the fine hairs, too slow will pull up molten filament
variable_dip_extraction_speed   : 70		; Speed mm/s - Around 2x Insertion speed to prevents forming new hairs
variable_melt_zone_pause        : 0		; Pause if melt zone in ms. Default 0
variable_cooling_zone_pause     : 0		; Pause if cooling zone after dip in ms. Default 0
variable_use_fast_skinnydip     : False		; False = Skip the toolhead temp change wait during skinnydip move

# Step 5 - Parking
# Park filament ready to eject
variable_parking_distance       : 0		; Position mm to park the filament at end of tip forming, 0 = leave where filament ends up after tip forming
variable_extruder_eject_speed   : 25		; Speed mm/s used for parking_distance (and final_eject when testing)
